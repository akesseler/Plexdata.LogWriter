## Plexdata.LogWriter.Console.Windows.Tests

This library just contains all tests for library ``Plexdata.LogWriter.Console.Windows``.

Actually, it is nothing to test in here, because of Facades are by design excluded from 
being tested, the Native logger can't be tested and both logging implementations just 
call their base class.
