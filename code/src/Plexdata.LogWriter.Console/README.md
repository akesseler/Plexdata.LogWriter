## Plexdata.LogWriter.Console

This library defines all ``ILogger`` derived interfaces that especially 
provide console logging.

Furthermore, this library includes classes that are shared between all 
available implementations of any of the console logger interfaces.

Unfortunately, this library can only be used together with one of the 
platform dependent console logger libraries. In other words, this library 
does not contain any logging related implementation.
