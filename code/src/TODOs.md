
**TODOs**

- Implement IDatabaseLogger
  - A logger that writes logging message into SQL databases.
- Implement IEventLogger
  - A logger that writes into the event log (a distinction between windows and others is possibly necessary).
- Implement IHttpLogger
  - A logger that posts logging message to remote servers.
- Migrating the libraries to .NET Standard v2.1 as soon as it is released.
