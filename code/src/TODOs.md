**TODOs**

* Change project icon, because it matches the argument parser icon!
* Implement IFileLogger 
  * Settings: Max File Size, Rolling 
  * Features: support multi-threading
* Implement IHttpLogger
* Implement IEventLogger
  * A logger that writes into the event log (a distinction between windows and others is possibly necessary).
* Implement IMultiLogger
  * A logger that combines a set of all other loggers.
* Migrating the libraries to .NET Standard v2.1 as soon as it is released.
