## Plexdata.LogWriter.Abstraction

This library defines all basic interfaces as well as other implementations 
of the *Plexdata Logging Writer*.

Furthermore, this library provides an implementation of an *Empty* logger. 
This special type of logging implementation might be for example useful 
when it is not yet clear which of the logging implementations should be 
used but logging has to be supported at all.
