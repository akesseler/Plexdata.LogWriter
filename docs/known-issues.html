<p>
    At the moment there are some known issues that will be pointed out in this chapter.
</p>

<h4>Graylog Support</h4>

<p>
    Please be aware, the <em>Graylog</em> support was implemented solely based on the official
    documentation of <em>Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF)</em> that is available on the Internet
    under <a href="https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-0/getting_in_log_data/gelf.html" target="_blank">https://go2docs.graylog.org/5-0/getting_in_log_data/gelf.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Conversely, this implementation has never been tested with a physical <em>Graylog</em> server!
    Unfortunately, this circumstance makes the implementation error-prone. Therefore, do not hesitate
    and immediately report any issue that occurs together with the <em>Graylog/GELF</em> implementation.
