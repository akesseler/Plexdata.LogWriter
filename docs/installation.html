<p>
    The whole bunch of libraries has been published on <a href="https://www.nuget.org" target="_blank">NuGet.org</a>
    and can be obtained from there. On that page search for <code>plexdata</code> and you will find all packages,
    including all logging writer packages.
</p>
<p>
    How to install the logging writer libraries manually is explained on <i>NuGet.org</i>. But for sure it
    doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to just download the libraries. It&rsquo;s indeed a better idea to include
    them in your C# projects.
</p>
<p>
    Below find the steps necessary to use the logging writer libraries together with <i>Visual Studio</i>.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Create or open a <i>.NET Framework</i> project, or a <i>.NET Standard</i> project, or a <i>.NET Core</i>
        project.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open menu <i>Tools &rarr; NuGet Package Manager</i> and choose command <i>
            Manage NuGet Packages for
            Solution&hellip;
        </i>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Alternatively, right&#8209;click the project in the <i>Solution Explorer</i> and choose command
                <i>Manage NuGet Packages&hellip;</i>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Switch to <i>Browse</i> page and in the search box just type <code>plexdata</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
        From the shown list just select for example package <i>Plexdata.LogWriter.Console.Windows</i>. Perhaps
        you may have to tick the check&ndash;box for all projects you want to assign the chosen package.
    </li>
    <li>
        Finally, click button <code>[Install]</code> at the right and confirm the dialog box. That&rsquo;s it.
        All dependent libraries are installed automatically.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    All sources as well as all binary files are available on <i>GitHub</i>. Thus, please feel free to browse the 
    logging writer project on <a href="https://github.com/akesseler/Plexdata.LogWriter" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
