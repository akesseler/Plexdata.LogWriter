<p>
    Well, the <i>Plexdata Logging Writer</i> is nothing else but yet another implementation
    of a logging framework. Someone may ask &ldquo;Do I need it?&rdquo; For sure, the answer
    is &ldquo;maybe&rdquo;. Thus, feel invited to test it.
</p>

<p>
    The whole project is split into different parts to be able to choose only the necessary
    logging functionality. These parts are shown in table below.

    <tr>
        <td><code>Plexdata.LogWriter.Abstraction.dll</code></td>
        <td>
            This library serves as the base of all other logging writer implementations and defines
            all interfaces and base implementations that are globally shared between other projects.
            Current target framework of this library is the <i>.NET Standard 2.0</i>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Plexdata.LogWriter.Composite.dll</code></td>
        <td>
            This library represents an <code>ILogger</code> derived implementation which supports composite logging.
            This logger version is available on any platform. Current target framework of this library is the
            <i>.NET Standard 2.0</i>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Plexdata.LogWriter.Console.dll</code></td>
        <td>
            This library contains all <code>ILogger</code> derived interfaces which especially support console
            logging. Other implementations, such as the settings, which refer to console logging are
            also part of this library. Current target framework of this library is the <i>.NET Standard 2.0</i>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Plexdata.LogWriter.Console.Standard.dll</code></td>
        <td>
            This library represents an <code>ILogger</code> derived implementation which supports standard console
            logging. This logger version is available on any platform. Current target framework of this
            library is the <i>.NET Standard 2.0</i>.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Plexdata.LogWriter.Console.Windows.dll</code></td>
        <td>
            This library represents an <code>ILogger</code> derived implementation which especially supports console
            logging for Windows applications. But keep in mind, this logger version is only available on
            Windows&trade; platforms! Current target framework of this library is the <i>.NET Standard 2.0</i>.

            <code>Plexdata.LogWriter.Persistent.dll</code>
        </td>
        <td>
            This library represents an <code>ILogger</code> derived implementation which supports persistent file logging.
            This logger version is available on any platform. Current target framework of this library is the
            <i>.NET Standard 2.0</i>.

        <td>
            This library represents an <code>ILogger</code> derived implementation which supports stream&ndash;based logging.
            This logger version is available on any platform. Current target framework of this library is the
            <i>.NET Standard 2.0</i>.
