<p>
    The persistent logger settings are the settings used together with each of the
    persistent respectively file logger implementations. These settings are defined
    in interface <code>IPersistentLoggerSettings</code>.

<h3 id="rules-check">Rules Check</h3>

<p>
    Before start reading about other details, it seems to be useful to discuss the rules and
    dependencies of some of the available properties. The following overview provides those
    information about the rules that are applied to the properties of this logger settings.
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        If rolling is <b>off</b> and the threshold is equal to or less than zero then only one
        logging file is written.
    </li>
    <li>
        If rolling is <b>off</b> and the threshold is greater than zero then a set of logging
        files are written, each of them with an appended time stamp.
    </li>
    <li>
        If rolling is <b>on</b> and the threshold is equal to or less than zero then a default
        threshold of five megabytes (5&nbsp;MiB) is used and rolling is applied with that default
        threshold.
    </li>
    <li>
        If rolling is <b>on</b> and the threshold is greater than zero then rolling is applied
        with that threshold.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    In case of rolling, a first logging file with suffix <code>_one</code> is created. If that file
    reaches the threshold then the first file is closed and a second file with suffix <code>_two</code>
    is created. If the second file reaches the threshold then the second file is cloesed and the
    first file is reopened. In that case the content of the fist file is completely discarded. This
    behaviour is repeated as long as the &ldquo;rolling&rdquo; logging takes place.
</p>

<h3 id="filename">Filename</h3>

<p>
    The property <code>Filename</code> returns the fully qualified name of the assigned logging file.
    The default logging file is located in the current user&rsquo;s temporary folder and is named
    <code>plexdata.log</code>.
</p>

<p>
    But before a file name can be used, it is checked if it includes a directory. If this is <i>not</i>
    the case then the default directory is used instead. This default directory points to the current
    user&rsquo;s temporary folder and is named <code>logging</code>. Take a look at example below.
</p>

<pre id="logger-settings-filename-1"><code>settings.Filename = "output.log";
String filename = settings.Filename; // C:\Users\&lt;user-name&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp\logging\output.log</code></pre>

<p>
    Additionally, it is tried to create any missing directory part. This applies to the default directory
    as well.
</p>

<p>
    With this new feature in mind, it is not required anymore that an output folder must exist
    beforehand. But be aware, any process using the persistent logger must have write permission to the
    provided output directory!
</p>

<p>
    Property <code>Filename</code> can also process paths that come from environment variables. Below
    find some examples of standard Windows environment variables and how to use them.
</p>

<pre id="logger-settings-output-1"><code>settings.Filename = "%TMP%\\output.log";
settings.Filename = "%TEMP%\\output.log";
settings.Filename = "%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Temp\\output.log";
settings.Filename = "%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\output.log";</code></pre>

<h3 id="rolling">Rolling</h3>

<p>
    The property <code>IsRolling</code> allows enabling or disabling the rolling of logging files.
    Rolling means that the real logging file changes if a particular condition is satisfied. The
    default value is <code>OFF</code> but might be changes by derived classes.
</p>

<h3 id="queuing">Queuing</h3>

<p>
    The property <code>IsQueuing</code> allows enabling or disabling of message queuing. This means
    messages are written directly into the logging file if message queuing is disabled. The other way
    round, message to write are cached before they will be written. The default value is <code>OFF</code>
    but might be changes by derived classes.
</p>

<p>
    But no matter if queuing is enabled or disabled, there is no guaranteed that all written logging
    message are in chronological order. The reason behind is that the persistent logging can be used in
    a multi&ndash;threading environment respectively multiple processes try writing logging messages at
    the same time.
</p>

<h3 id="threshold">Threshold</h3>

<p>
    The property <code>Threshold</code> represents the size in kilobyte at when a logging file should
    be switched and is actually just a approximate value. This in turn means that the file size is
    determined after a logging message has been written. On the other hand, a threshold of less than
    or equal to zero means no limitation. The default value is <code>-1</code> but might be changes
    by derived classes.
</p>

<h3 id="encoding">Encoding</h3>

<p>
    The property <code>Encoding</code> allows to change the file encoding to be used. The default value
    is <code>UTF&ndash;8</code> but might be changes by derived classes.
