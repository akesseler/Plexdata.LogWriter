<p>
    The composite logger settings are the settings used together with each of the composite logger implementations.
    These settings are defined in interface <code>ICompositeLoggerSettings</code>.

<p>
    In contrast to other logger settings, the composite logger settings implementation does not provide a set of
    own properties. The underlying implementation is more or less a placeholder for the settings values of interface
    <code>ILoggerSettings</code>.
</p>

<p>
    At the moment, the only really important property is property <code>LogLevel</code>, because this property is
    actively used by the composite logger implementation. For example, method <code>IsEnabled()</code> uses this
    property to determine if logging is enabled for a particular logging level. And that&rsquo;s exactly what the
    composite logger does. Against this background there are some consequences.
</p>

<p>
    Changing the logging level of one of the assigned loggers and asking then the composite logger if a particular
    logging level is enabled, the composite logger will always compare its own logging level, no matter if one of
    underlying loggers uses a higher or lower logging level.
</p>

<p>
    This behavior affects the writing of logging messages as well. In other word, the logging level of the composite
    logger decides which of the message types is forwarded to the underlying loggers. Nevertheless, such a logging
    message might be suppressed by one of the assigned sub&#8209;loggers. Here an example of what is meant in detail.
</p>

<p>
    Assuming the composite logger has assigned two loggers, one console logger and one stream logger. The composite
    logger uses logging level <code>Verbose</code>, the console logger uses logging level <code>Debug</code>, and the
    stream logger uses logging level <code>Warning</code>. Furthermore, a set of logging message should to be written.
    And which of these messages is written under these conditions is shown in table below.
</p>

<table>
    <tr><th>Message</th><th>Composite</th><th>Console</th><th>Stream</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Trace</td><td>suppressed</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Debug</td><td>suppressed</td><td>&mdash;</td><td>&mdash;</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Verbose</td><td>forwarded</td><td>written</td><td>suppressed</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Message</td><td>forwarded</td><td>written</td><td>suppressed</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Warning</td><td>forwarded</td><td>written</td><td>written</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Error</td><td>forwarded</td><td>written</td><td>written</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Fatal</td><td>forwarded</td><td>written</td><td>written</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Critical</td><td>forwarded</td><td>written</td><td>written</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
    The default constructor of each composite logger creates its own settings instance and initializes it with its
    default values. The only exception is the logging level. The composite logger uses <code>Trace</code> as default
    logging level instead of logging level <code>Message</code>. This ensures that none of the messages is suppressed
    by default.
