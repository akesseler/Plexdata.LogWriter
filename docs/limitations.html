<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>

<p>
    At the moment there are some known limitations that will be pointed out in this chapter.
</p>

<h4>Logger Settings</h4>

<p>
    Unfortunately, not all of the <i>Logger Settings</i> can be used in a configuration file
    when dependency injection is used. For example, this applies to the <code>Coloring</code>
    property. The reason behind, some of the properties have a property getter only and such
    properties cannot be modified by any external code.
</p>

<h4>Console Logger for Windows</h4>

<p>
    As already mentioned, the <i>Console Logger for Windows</i> cannot be used on platforms other
    than Windows. The reason behind, this logging writer uses functions of the Win32&ndash;API
    directly. These functions are not available on other platforms.
