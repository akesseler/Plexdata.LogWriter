<p>
    At the moment there are some known limitations that will be pointed out in this chapter.
</p>

<h4>Console Logger for Windows</h4>

<p>
    As already mentioned, the <i>Console Logger for Windows</i> cannot be used on platforms other
    than Windows. The reason behind, this logging writer uses functions of the Win32&ndash;API
    directly. These functions are not available on other platforms.
</p>

<h4>Persistent Logger Settings</h4>

<p>
    It is no longer required that the path of a provided filename must exist. But a process must 
    still have write access to the existing parent directory.
